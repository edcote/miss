# MISS (MIPS Instruction Set Simulator)

This is an update to [here](http://code.google.com/p/mipsim-python/downloads/detail?name=SimpleMIPS-0.1.py) adding the parsing of ELF executables, a mechanism for instruction trace generation, and support for a few new instructions. I don't recall my changes being 100% complete.
